Snake
=====

My second attempt at making a Snake game using the Graphics library of C++. The movement kind of sucks now but hey, http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/114/139/tumblr_lgedv2Vtt21qf4x93o1_40020110725-22047-38imqt.jpg .
I'll try to make it better over time if I get the time. :)


1. Press a to move left , w to move up , x to move down , d to move right and p to stop and exit.  
2. There's no real way the game ends automatically. You win it or it doesn't end. When your snake length reaches 
   10 units, you win.
